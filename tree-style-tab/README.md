# Tree Style Tab - Custom Sidebar Theme

This is my custom user style for the [Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/) Firefox extension, designed to be used with the built-in **Sidebar** theme.

## 🎨 Features

- **Unread tabs** are highlighted in **red and italic**.
- **Private tabs** are marked with a 🕶 emoji.
- Font is updated for a **modern, clean look** with increased size.
- **Active tab** is styled with bold text and a blue accent.
- **Hover effects** for tab items.
- Improved **favicon styling** and **custom close button** (⨉).
- Scrollbar and background stylings for a sleek dark sidebar appearance.

## 📁 File

- `sidebar-theme.css` — the user stylesheet to be applied via Tree Style Tab’s settings.

2. Go to **Add-ons > Tree Style Tab > Preferences > Advanced > User Style Sheet**.
3. Copy and paste the contents of `sidebar-theme.css` into the textbox.
